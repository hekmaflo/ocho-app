# ocho-app

OCHO is a web application that allows users to create custom top 8 lists to showcase their interests and likes. The app is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## How OCHO works

To use OCHO, simply sign up for an account and start creating your custom top 8 lists. You can choose from a variety of categories, including movies, music, places to visit, TV shows, or create your own custom lists. Once you've chosen your category, you can select the eight items that you want to include in your list. OCHO allows you to add images related to each item to make your list more visually appealing.

Your top 8 lists will be displayed on your profile page, where your followers can see them and get to know you better. You can update your top 8 lists as often as you like, adding new items or changing the order to keep things fresh and interesting.

In addition to creating custom top 8 lists, OCHO also allows you to write a brief description about each item you include in your list. This allows your followers to learn more about why each item is important to you and what you love about it. To view the description, simply click on the item in the list.
